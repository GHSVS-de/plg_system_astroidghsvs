PLG_SYSTEM_ASTROIDGHSVS_XML_DESCRIPTION="Plugin to support templates based on the Astroid framework and other templates. For example, for more controllable SCSS compilation. Out of the box, the plugin is of little use and can even \"block\" if appropriate adjustments are not made in template codes. If you have problems, ask www.ghsvs.de."
