PLG_SYSTEM_ASTROIDGHSVS_XML_DESCRIPTION="Plugin to support templates based on the Astroid framework, BUT ALSO other templates. For example, for more controllable SCSS compilation. The plugin is of little use out of the box and can even \"block\" if appropriate adjustments are not also made in template codes. Ask at www.ghsvs.de for more information. <strong>The SCSS compiler and most plugin settings can be used also with non-Astroid templates.</strong>"
